# RayRPG

An RPG that continues playing, spawning battles and item drops randomly (enemies increase gradually in difficulty.) You should have the following attributes to your character: Name, attack, defense, HP, mana, stamina, and xp.

Character level increases upon reaching xp requirements, each level up increasing an attribute and increasing xp needed for next level up.

Enemies are objects too. They should get more difficult as the game progresses.
Items should drop randomly from enemies."
